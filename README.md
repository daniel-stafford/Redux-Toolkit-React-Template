# React + Redux Toolkit + Redux Persist + Styled Components + Husky ðŸ”¥

### A simple template with my current favorite tech stack.  Uses Typescript with React, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist for local storage, and a very simple theme toggle using CSS variables and styled complonents. Also prelints any commits with prettier and ESLint. 

Built with Create React App and a lot of fiddling. Enjoy! ðŸ˜„

Tip: Use the Redux dev tools to see how state is controlled/stored.
